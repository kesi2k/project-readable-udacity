    this.props.getCategories()
  }









AddPost : author, body, category, commentCount, deleted, id, timestamp, title, voteScore, deleted, parentDeleted




Create reducers for categories and others then combine it in index.js

	0) Construct API call
	1) Setup action with API call
	2) Setup reducer which takes action and state and returns new state
	3) Attach react-component with connect to redux, pass in imported action and use mapstateToProps



	Redux stores are setup in the reducers.
	Use react-redux to connect components (via mapStateToProps) to react components


	Main Page:
		All categories. Pass in posts component to categories

		All posts. Pass
